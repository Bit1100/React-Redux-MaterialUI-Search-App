# Walk through of the Project

The project deals with the searching of the users,which we get on form submission from the table on the fly. The project is the combo of React and MaterialUI. The other details are as follows:

## Styling

SASS

## React Component Type

Functional Component with various hooks like useState(), useEffect(), useContext()

## LocalStorage

Beautifully Used localStorage to hold the data permanently unless it's being manually deleted.

## State Management

Used Context API for data distribution across the components.

## Best Practices

Files are well-organised, components, context, storage, images, styles and are in separate file making app structure clear to understand and scalable in nature.
